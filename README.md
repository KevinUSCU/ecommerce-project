Here is our reskinning of the ecommerce merchant, Rapha. An elegant, high quality, high fashion cycling attire retailer.

We look to create a welcoming homepage adorned with new arrival products, some high-res branding (giving our users a little
flavor of what we are all about), and a way for our fans to stay in touch with us through the use of a newletter signup.

Additionally, we'll craft a checkout page for those that are ready to purchase.
